While this Christmas
I am falling like snowflakes at your door
As my guardian angel's singing for someone else
Eternity stains when love has turned into pain
love must be something I don′t deserve
This is my private Christmas Song


All the memories are fading
Snow turns to rain
As tonight I am craving for those endless kisses
A melody written for someone
just as a child has its parents
This song is something you never care for
This is my Private Christmas song
This is my Private Christmas Song
