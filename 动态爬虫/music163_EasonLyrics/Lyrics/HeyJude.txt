Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
 Take a sad song and make it better.
 Remember to let her into your heart,
 Then you can start to make it better.
 Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
 You were made to go out and get her.
 The minute you let her under your skin,
 Then you begin to make it better.
 And anytime you feel the pain,
 hey Jude, refrain,
 Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
 For well you know that its
 a fool who plays it cool
 By making his world a little colder.
 Hey Jude, dont let me down.
 You have found her, now go and get her.
 Remember to let her into your heart,
 Then you can start to make it better.
 So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
 Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
 And dont you know that its just you,
 hey Jude, youll do,
 The movement you need is on your shoulder.
 Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
 Take a sad song and make it better.
 Remember to let her under your skin,
 Then youll begin to make it
 Better better better
 better better better, oh.
