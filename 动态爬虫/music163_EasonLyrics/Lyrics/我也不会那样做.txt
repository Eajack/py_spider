This is the story, story of love.
Story of abuse, Story of apologies.
Too late.
口口声声听到你说，
你会为了他离开我。
跟他挂了电话看都不看我，
默默无言的走过。
If I only never heard you say it to him，
也许我也不会难过。
If I only could believe that you were lying to him，
我的拳头，也许不会 Hit you!
不是不要向你道歉，
只是害怕失去尊严。
当我感觉到那冰冷的手铐，
一百个 Sorry 也听不见。
If I only never heard you say it to him，
也许我也不会难过。
If I only could believe that you were lying to him，
我也不会那么做，那么做。
If I only never heard you say it to him，
也许我也不会难过。
If I only could believe that you were lying to him，
我也不会那么做，那么做。
