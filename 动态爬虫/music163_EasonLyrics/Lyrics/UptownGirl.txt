uptown  girl
she ′s  been  living  in  her  uptown  world
i  bet  she  never  had  a  back  street  guy
i  bet  her  mama  never  told  her  why
i ′m  gonna  try  for  an  uptown  girl
she ′s  been  living  in  her  white  bread  world
as  long  as  anyone  with  hot  blood  can
and  now  she ′s  looking  for  a  downtown  man
that ′s  what  i  am
and  when  she  knows  what
she  wants  from  her  time
and  when  she  wakes  up
and  makes  up  her  mind
she ′ll  see  i ′m  not  so  tough
just  because
i ′m  in  love  with  an  uptown  girl
you  know  i ′ve  seen  her  in  her  uptown  world
she ′s  getting  tired  of  her  high  class  toys
and  all  her  presents  from  her  uptown  boys
she ′s  got  a  choice
uptown  girl
you  know  i  can ′t  afford  to  buy  her  pearls
but  maybe  someday  when  my  ship  comes  in
she ′ll  understand  what  kind  of  guy  i ′ve  been
and  then  i ′ll  win
and  when  she ′s  walking
she ′s  looking  so  fine
and  when  she ′s  talking
she ′ll  say  that  she ′s  mine
she ′ll  say  i ′m  not  so  tough
just  because
i ′m  in  love
with  an  uptown  girl
she ′s  been  living  in  her  white  bread  world
as  long  as  anyone  with  hot  blood  can
and  now  she ′s  looking  for  a  downtown  man
that ′s  what  i  am
uptown  girl
she ′s  my  uptown  girl
uptown  girl
she  my  uptown  girl
uptown  girl
she  my  uptown  girl
uptown  girl
she  my  uptown  girl
我爱你
