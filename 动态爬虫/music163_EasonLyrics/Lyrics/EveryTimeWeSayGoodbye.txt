Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
While clouds above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go
When you're near
There's such an air
Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song final
But how strange to change
From major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
