Man  it's  a  hot  one
Like  seven  inches  from  the  midday  sun
I  hear  you  whisper  and  the  words  melt  everyone
But  you  stay  so  cool
My  mu-equita,my  Spanish  harlem  mona  lisa
You're  my  reason  for  reason
you're  The  step  in  my  groove
And  if  i  say  this  life  ain't  good  enough
I  would  give  my  world  to  lift  you  up
I  could  change  my  life  to  better  suit  your  mood
Cause  you're  so  smooth
And  just  like  the  ocean  under  the  moon
Well  that's  the  same  emotion  that  I  get  from  you
You  got  the  kind  of  lovin'that  can  be  so  smooth
Gimme  your  heart,make  it  real
Or  else  forget  about  it
well  I'll  tell  you  one  thing
In  every  breath  and  every  word
I  hear  your  calling  my  name
Out  of  the  barrio
You  hear  my  rhythm  from  your  radio
You  see  the  world  turn  around  so  soft  and  slow
Turning  you  round  round  and  round
And  if  i  say  this  life  ain't  good  enough
I  would  give  my  world  to  lift  you  up
I  could  change  my  life  to  better  suit  your  mood
Cause  you're  so  smooth
And  just  like  the  ocean  under  the  moon
Well  that's  the  same  emotion  that  I  get  from  you
You  got  the  kind  of  lovin'that  can  be  so  smooth
Gimme  your  heart,make  it  real
Or  else  forget  about  it
And  just  like  the  ocean  under  the  moon
Well  that's  the  same  emotion  that  I  get  from  you
You  got  the  kind  of  lovin'that  can  be  so  smooth
Gimme  your  heart,make  it  real  Or  else  forget  about  it  Or  else  forget  about  it  Or  else  forget  about  it  Or  else  forget  about  it  Or  else  forget  about  it
Or  else  forget  about  it  Or  else  forget  about  it  Or  else  forget  about  it  Or  else  forget  about  it
