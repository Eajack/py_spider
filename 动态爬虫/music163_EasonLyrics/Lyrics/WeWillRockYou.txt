Buddy you are a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on yo'face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place
Singin'We will we will rock you

Shoutin' in the street gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on yo'face
You big disgrace
Wavin' your banner all over the place
Singin'We will we will rock you

Buddy you are an old man poor man
Pleadin' with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day
You got mud on your face
You big digrace
Somebody gonna put you back in your place
Singin'We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you
