guiding through a way in the night
Rainbows in the sky neon lights
the Road is ahead take us to all new heights
It's a city that will make you feel bright

Standing tall with pride
culture side by side
Living in a place where we can reach for the sky

We can all hold hands
with the world we stand
Living up our dreams and hope
will give us a chance

Open up your eyes
you'll realize
The city that will change
the way you are make you fly
Live a better life
Oh yeah



Looking through the window of time
I believe a future that shines
One by one we search and we will find
Build a better place for all of mankind

Standing tall with pride
Country side by side
Living in a place where
we could reach for the sky
We can all hold handswith
the world we stand
Living up of our dream and hope will give us a chance
Open up your eyes
you will realize
The city that will change the way you are make you fly
Live a better life

(We are the life side by side)
Live a better life
(let's find a way side by side)
Side by side yeah
(We will rise up side by side)
City always by your side
