I see trees of green'
red roses too
I see them bloom
for me and you
And I think to myself
what a wonderful world.
I see skies of blue
and clouds of white
The bright blessed day'
the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
what a wonderful world.
The colors of the rainbow
so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you.
I hear babies cry'
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
what a wonderful world
