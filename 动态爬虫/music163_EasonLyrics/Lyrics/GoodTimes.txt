（hey you had a good time right? so did i）
 作曲 : 陈伟
 作词 : 陈伟/于光中
不必算太清楚，心里就明白。
周一到周五不过
快乐就非要限量版
为别人活都不算
我们只剩下周末
bon bon ba la da bon bon
倒带一分钟，我们重新再来过。
听听你的上半身在说什么。
a-hun ～ a-hun ～ a-hun ～ wo ～
我听见 gotta have a good time
it's party time come on
everybody wants to
everybody needs to
come on have a good time
it's summer time oh yeah!
got to get together
shake that funky weather
got to have a good time
it's x'mas time come on
不分任何国度 日蚀才会结束
come on have a good time
it's valentine oh yeah!
不管别人觉得 快乐就是规则
got to have a good time
it's party time come on
不必非要求婚 香槟才打开
你想做就快去做
气氛不是年度预算
感觉够了最自然
就算只剩下你我
bon bon ba la da bon bon
快转一分钟 决定错的都跳过
听听你的下半身在说什么
a-hun ～ a-hun ～ a-hun ～ wo ～
我听见 gotta have a good time
it's party time come on
everybody wants to
everybody needs to
come on have a good time
it's summer time oh yeah!
got to get together
shake that funky weather
got to have a good time
it's x'mas time come on
不分任何国度 日蚀才会结束
come on have a good time
it's valentine oh yeah!
不管别人觉得 快乐就是规则
got to have a good time
it's party time come on
everybody wants to
everybody needs to
come on have a good time
it's summer time oh yeah!
got to get together
shake that funky weather
got to have a good time
it's x'mas time come on
everybody wants to
everybody needs to
come on have a good time
it's summer time oh yeah!
got to get together
shake that funky weather
got to have a good time

不分任何国度 日蚀才会结束
