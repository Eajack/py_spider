Hey, you once called me your baby
say it for the last time
with all your strength and meaning it this time
Hey, you once promised me the world
but I never asked for it
but I never asked for it
Hey, you once praised me beautiful

why I`d get get weaker
why would I get weaker

oh Please, please don`t,
I am so scared, scared you`re too perfect for me
or am I too naive for you

either way it`s too late

too late for regrets, I`m hurrrrrrt
leave me out of love
leave love out, leave me out

hey, let`s just pretend
nothing ever happened

nothing ever happened
hey, let`s just pretend
nothing ever happened
nothing nothing never ever happened
